# Fake-Indian-Currency-Classification-using-PCA-ANN


This project focuses on detecting fake Indian currency notes using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature reduction and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for classification. The system analyzes image features of currency notes and accurately classifies them as Genuine or Fake.

OBJECTIVES

-Reduce high-dimensional image data using PCA

-Train an ANN model for efficient classification

-Improve accuracy and reduce computational complexity

-Build a reliable system for fake currency detection
